These are strategically located with proper colour coding, like green for biodegradable waste, blue for recyclable waste, and yellow for other waste categories, ensuring systematic segregation of wastes. We strongly encourage everyone on the campus to use minimal plastic and promote the usage of eco-friendly products, such as paper cups and paper bags, to maintain a plastic-free campus environment."

Green waste generated from gardens and landscape areas, such as dry leaves, pruning residues, grass clippings, and other horticulture waste, is collected and processed through vermicomposting. In this process, organic waste is decomposed by earthworms and converted into nutrient-rich vermin-compost. This method speeds up the decomposition process and improves the quality of organic manure. Wet waste collected from the cafeteria and canteen is also combined with suitable horticulture waste and treated in composting and vermicomposting units to produce high-quality organic fertiliser. The compost produced from these processes is used to maintain the campus greenery, plantations, and gardens, supporting an eco-friendly and circular approach towards waste management."

                <br /><br />
                Departments are strictly instructed to submit outdated or non-functional electronic devices, such as monitors, keyboards, printers, batteries, cables, and other laboratory equipment to the E-Waste Store. By following all safety norms, these items are further segregated according to their categories and kept for temporary storage and monitoring before final disposal.
                <br /><br />
                To ensure the responsible disposal of waste, the University has signed MoUs with certified and authorised e-waste management vendors. The collected e-waste is periodically handed over to these authorised recyclers for scientific dismantling, recycling, and recovery of reusable materials. This prevents environmental and health hazards caused by toxic components such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and other harmful substances present in electronic devices.
