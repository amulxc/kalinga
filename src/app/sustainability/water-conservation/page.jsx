        "In alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Kalinga University follows sustainable water management practices to conserve and utilise water resources through a combination of infrastructure-based and awareness-driven initiatives. A Sewage Treatment Plant is installed to treat wastewater that is used for gardening and landscape purposes. Drip irrigation systems are implemented across lawns, gardens, and green belts, reducing water wastage and promoting plant growth.",
        "In addition, rainwater harvesting and bore-well recharge systems restore groundwater and support long-term water availability. The University also conducts various water conservation awareness programs and conducts special activities on World Water Day. These measures not only conserve water resources but also encourage students and staff to become environmentally responsible."
