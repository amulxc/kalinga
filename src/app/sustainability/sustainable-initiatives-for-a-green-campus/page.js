With this CoE, students learn A-Z manufacturing and functioning of a wide range of EVs, including E-Auto, E-Cycle, E-Scooter, and E-Cargo vehicles. The university actively encourages staff members to adopt carpooling practices, helping reduce fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and carbon emissions. Additionally, well-organized bus facilities are provided to ensure safe, reliable, and convenient commuting for staff. These combined efforts demonstrate the institution’s strong commitment to environmental responsibility, energy conservation, and building a greener, more sustainable campus culture.",
