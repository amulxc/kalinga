        "To promote sustainability and environmental responsibility, the University is taking various green initiatives and contributing towards various United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The campus features a green landscape that supports ecological balance and biodiversity, pedestrian-friendly pathways, and the use of sustainable modes of transportation like bicycles and e-vehicles. Solar panels and LED lights installed in different buildings reduce electricity consumption and promote the usage of renewable sources of energy. Various outreach activities, environmental-focused projects, and research initiatives build awareness among students and staff."
