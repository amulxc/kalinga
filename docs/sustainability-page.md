# Sustainability page (`/sustainability`)

The Sustainability page presents the work of the University's SDG Cell. It uses a
two-column layout: a sticky **side panel** on the left and stacked content
sections on the right, in the order defined by the
"Sustainability - New Content" document.

## Layout

| Breakpoint | Navigation |
| --- | --- |
| `lg` and up | Sticky side rail (`SustainabilitySideNav`) beside the content |
| below `lg` | Collapsible picker pinned under the site header (`SustainabilitySectionPicker`) |

Both surfaces are driven by the same section list and the same active-section
state, so they can never drift apart.

The page banner and breadcrumb come from the global `Breadcrumb` component via
`src/lib/pageData.ts` — the page itself does not render a hero. The banner image
is `public/banners/sustainability-banner.webp` (SDG Cell team, 2000px wide),
cropped with `imagePosition: "object-center"` so the team stays in the 400px
band. Next.js runs with `images.unoptimized`, so banner artwork must be sized
down before it is committed rather than relying on the image pipeline.

## Section order

1. `sdg-cell` — Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Cell, followed by the
   "Kalinga University's Commitment Towards SDGs" sub-heading
2. `mission-vision` — Vision, mission and the SDG alignment that sits under it
3. `sdg-cell-composition` — SDG Cell members table
4. `sustainability-policies` — a "Sustainability Policy" disclosure (UN goal
   overview, the role of universities, policy statement) followed by the
   goal → theme → policies table under its own heading
5. `centres-of-excellence` — Centre of Excellence (CoE): the 2022 and 2025
   office orders, each expanding to its full text and signed PDF
6. `annual-reports` — Annual reports 2022–23, 2023–24, 2024–25
7. `sustainable-development-goals` — The 17 goal tiles with goal-wise reports
8. `our-initiatives` — Links to the six initiative detail pages
9. `student-engagement` — "Clubs": Green Club and BIS Standard Club

## Policy and report PDFs

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `public/sdg-reports/` | Goal-wise SDG reports linked from the 17 goal tiles |
| `public/sdg-policies/` | Policy documents linked from the Sustainability Policies table |

A row in `SUSTAINABILITY_POLICIES` lists each policy as a plain string, or as
`{ label, pdfUrl }` once its document exists — only the second form renders as a
link. Drop the PDF into `public/sdg-policies/` using the exact filename in
`pdfUrl`, or the link will 404.

## Editing content

All copy, tables, links and image URLs live in `components/sustainability/data/`.
Editing a section normally means editing one data file — the section components
only handle presentation.

- **Adding or reordering a section**: add/move the entry in `data/navigation.js`
  and place the matching component in the same position in
  `SustainabilityClient.jsx`. The anchor id must match the `id` passed to
  `SectionBlock`.
- **Goal-wise SDG reports**: drop the PDF into `public/sdg-reports/` and add an
  entry to `SDG_GOAL_REPORTS` in `data/sdg-content.js`, keyed by goal number.
  Only goals present in that map become clickable and show the "View Report"
  ribbon. Reports open in a new tab and render in the browser's built-in PDF
  viewer. Currently only SDG 2 has a published report
  (`public/sdg-reports/sdg-02-zero-hunger-report.pdf`).
- **Our Initiatives**: `SUSTAINABILITY_INITIATIVES` in
  `data/initiatives-content.js` — each entry links to its detail page under
  `src/app/sustainability/<slug>/`.
- **Office orders**: `OFFICE_ORDERS` in `data/coe-content.js` holds the full text
  of each order plus the link to the signed PDF. They render inside the Centre of
  Excellence (CoE) tab — there is no separate Office Orders tab.

## Notes

- Tab 4 nests content: `SustainabilityPoliciesSection` renders a
  "Sustainability Policy" button that discloses `policy/SdgOverview`,
  `policy/UniversitiesRole` and `policy/PolicyStatement`, then always shows
  `policy/PoliciesTable`. Those four are content-only — they carry their own
  headings but no `SectionBlock`, so they can be reordered or moved without
  touching the side panel.

- Copy in `data/` stays plain text. Where it contains ordinals ("12th April",
  "7th Semester"), the rendering section wraps the string in `<OrdinalText>`,
  which raises the suffix. If you add copy with a date or semester to a section
  that does not use it yet, wrap it there too.

- Section anchors carry `scroll-mt-[150px]` so headings clear the sticky header
  and, on mobile, the section picker. The scroll-spy reading line in
  `useScrollSpy.js` (`OFFSET = 160`) must stay above that value.
- Documents open in a new tab rather than the in-page flipbook, matching the rest
  of the SDG Cell material.
